1. We create two new function for the ALS method in the folder "nmfv1_4". The names of the two function is "wnmfrule_als.m" and "wnmfrule2.m".

2."Project3_P1.m" is for the first problem. 
  "Project3_P2.m" is for the second problem. 
  "Project3_P3.m" is for the third problem. 
  "Project3_P4.m" is for the first part of the fourth problem. 
  "Project3_P4_lambda.m" is for the second part of the fourth problem. 
  "Project3_P5.m" is for the fifth problem.

3. Each of the code can run independently. You can run anyone of them directly.
